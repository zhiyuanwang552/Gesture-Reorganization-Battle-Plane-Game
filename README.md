# Gesture-Reorganization-Battle-Plane-Game
This is a battle plane game where the player gets to control the plane with gesture "Thumbs Up" and "Thumbs Down" to avoid asteroids
from hitting the plane. 

Each bullet deals 10 damage to the asteroids where each asteroid has 10 HP

The project Utilised OpenCV to acquire video frame from your device's camera, and Mediapipe to recognize your hand gesture

For smooth gameplay and better experience, it is better to keep only one hand visible; it could be either left or right.
